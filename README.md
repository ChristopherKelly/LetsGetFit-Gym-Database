This was my first database design project. There are a few coding oddities to be clear on.
  -  The assessor for the project wanted all code to be in 1 file. Hence why each stored procedure is in main.sql
  -  Each element was intended to be run on selection. Not ideal, and I've learned how to structure projects better now. It is what it is.
  -  As such the other .sql files are copies of what's already in main. When properly factorized main.sql would have refered to these instead.
